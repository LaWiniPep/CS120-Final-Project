I learned many things over the course of the project. Mostly it was my determination to figure something new out. But I also learned a lot about coding and calling in different variables to assist with getting processes to work. 

I got stuck on many things but the building of the whole world had me stuck the longest.

I still could not figure out collisions, and that is simply because I ran out of time. I could have gotten it if I wasn't hurrying to just get a working game in.

Next time I would not choose a "large" (at least to me) project and choose something simpler but I wanted to challenge myself and also give myself an opportunity to improve on this game going forward.  

I do not believe I strayed too far from my game design doc. But made adjustments when something was too hard or couldn't figure out how to code.

I appreciate the time given to review my assignment and I hope you enjoy it more than I did making it!

Also no music. I didn't want to do that to me or the player.
